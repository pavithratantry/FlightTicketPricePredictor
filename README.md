# Flight Ticket Price Predictor

Flight ticket prices are usually hard to guess. The price we see today might not be the
same tomorrow. It can vary due to many factors like flight distance, competition, timing of
flight, timing of purchase, number of flights, empty middle seats and many more. We canâ€™t keep
all these factors in mind everytime we want to purchase tickets. This project is going to help us
find flight tickets with the best price considering all our needs.
